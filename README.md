## 🛠️ Key Commands

- `npm run dev`: Start development server.
- `npm run build`: Build for production.
- `npm run db:push`: Deploy schema changes to the database.
- `npm run db:studio`: Open Drizzle Studio to view data.
- `npm run db:seed`: Populate the database with initial data (e.g., default course).

## 🌱 Database Seeding & Initial Data

The application requires certain data to function correctly. If the database is empty, you may encounter errors like "Course not found".

### Required Initial Data
1.  **Courses**: At least one course must exist for the enrollment page (`/enroll/[courseId]`) to work.
2.  **Users**: You can register a new user via the Sign In page. To access the Admin Dashboard, you must manually update the user's role to `admin` in the database.

### How to Seed
Run the following command to create a default course:
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### Handling Missing Data
- **"Course not found"**: Run the seed script or create a course manually via the Admin Dashboard (once you have admin access).
- **"User not found"**: Ensure you have registered or that the auto-registration flow (Guest Checkout) is working.
